    <p>Renewable energy is energy produced from sources like the sun and wind that are naturally replenished and do not run out. Renewable energy can be used for electricity generation, space and water heating and cooling, and transportation.</p>

      <p>Non-renewable energy, in contrast, comes from finite sources that could get used up, such as fossil fuels like coal and oil.</p>

    <h2>Types of Renewable Energy</h2>
      <p>Renewable energy sources, such as biomass, geothermal resources, sunlight, water, and wind, are natural resources that can be converted into these types of clean, usable energy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bioenergy</li>

      <li>Geothermal energy</li>

      <li>Hydropower</li>

      <li>Marine energy</li>

      <li>Solar energy</li>

      <li>Wind energy</li>
    </ul>
